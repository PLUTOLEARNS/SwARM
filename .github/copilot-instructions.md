## Project: Swarm-based Intrusion Detection System ✅ COMPLETE
This project implements a distributed intrusion detection system using swarm intelligence principles with Python and pytest for testing.

### Project Status: ✅ Fully Functional Base System
- ✅ Configuration management with YAML support
- ✅ Logging utilities with rotation
- ✅ Metrics collection system
- ✅ Swarm manager with mock agents
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (19 tests passing)
- ✅ Virtual environment configured
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ VS Code tasks configured
- ✅ Application successfully launched and tested

### Next Development Steps:
1. Implement real detection agents (replace mock agents)
2. Add network monitoring capabilities
3. Implement machine learning detection algorithms
4. Add database persistence
5. Create web dashboard
6. Enhance swarm intelligence algorithms
